# React Native TCKN Validator

This is a React Native application that utilizes the tckn-validator npm package to create a user registration page with username and Turkish identification number (TCKN) validation

## Installation

Before running the application, make sure you have completed the React Native environment setup and have created a new React Native project using @react-native-community/cli. Once you have set up your project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install the tckn-validator package using npm or Yarn:

```bash
# using npm
npm install tckn-validator

# OR using Yarn
yarn add tckn-validator
```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
